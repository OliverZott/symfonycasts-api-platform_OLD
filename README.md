# API Platform Tutorial
[API Platform](https://symfonycasts.com/screencast/api-platform)

## Setup
1. **Download Composer dependencies**
    ```
    composer install
    composer require
    ```
    You may alternatively need to run `php composer.phar install`, depending
    on how you installed Composer.

2. **Start the built-in web server**
    
    ```
    symfony server:
    
    symfony serve
    ```
    (If this is your first time using this command, you may see an
    error that you need to run `symfony server:ca:install` first).

3. **Install API Platform**
    ```
    composer require api 
    ```
